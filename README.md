# expense-tracker
Simple expense tracking project that uses a variety of different methods and array listings in order to keep track of the user's income and expense

# Use

Users can easily adjust their general/main balance from the "Adjust Balance" button at the top of the page and type in the amount of their current balance.
After that, by clicking on one of the desired checkboxes for either logging their income or their outcome, the user can type in their last transaction and after pressing
the submit button at the end of the modal they should get their final user balance.

## Updates
First Release: The user balance is working properly. However, it is not stored within the browser storage (localStorage) yet. Only the latest transactions are
getting saved within the storage.
